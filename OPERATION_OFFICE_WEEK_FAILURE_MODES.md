# Office Week Failure Modes (Action / Issue / Fix)

This table captures the most common human-facing failure modes when "PM work" is automated via durable agent workflows with HITL approvals (Control Tower pattern).

| Action (What Humans/Agents Do) | Issue (What Humans Experience) | Fix (Engineering + What Test Catches It) |
|---|---|---|
| Agents run Monday intake and emit many approval tickets for routine steps. | Approval inbox overload (too many medium-risk interrupts). Humans feel back in a synchronous bottleneck, just with different UX. | Add policy-based auto-approval for read-only actions; batch low-risk approvals; enforce per-run interrupt budgets and throttling; tune default risk levels. Test: "golden week" E2E sim asserting `interrupts_per_run <= budget` and ticket batching behavior. |
| Human opens a ticket "Context Pack" to decide quickly. | Context packs are untrustworthy (missing evidence, wrong summary, no links to sources). Humans must open raw timelines, killing the speedup. | Require a strict template with citations/pointers to artifacts and state snapshot; include "why now" + "what changed" fields; evaluate summarizer quality against a labeled set. Test: human-factor acceptance test measuring % of tickets requiring raw-log inspection below a threshold. |
| Humans read the weekly status report generated from Jira/Docs/Slack/email. | Phantom progress / contradictory status (green in report, blocked in system of record). Trust collapses quickly. | Define a canonical state model (single writer) and reconciliation rules; use optimistic concurrency for writes; attach provenance (source + timestamp) to every status fact. Test: integration tests that reconcile conflicting source updates deterministically and prevent double-writes. |
| Agent reaches an interrupt, waits hours, then resumes after approval. | Duplicate actions and spam (re-sent emails, repeated transitions, duplicate tickets) caused by replay on resume and retries. | Enforce effect-id idempotency wrappers for every side effect; use two-phase prepare/commit for risky actions; make nodes replay-safe. Test: replay/resume tests that resume the same checkpoint twice and assert exactly-once side effects. |
| Human approves a ticket late (after state has moved on). | Stale approvals (approval applies to old checkpoint; agent resumes into an invalid plan or fails). | Bind tickets to `(run_id, checkpoint_id/state_version)`; reject stale approvals and re-issue a new ticket with updated context. Test: concurrency tests that advance state then attempt to apply an old approval and assert rejection. |
| Agents call external tools (MCP + native tools) under real-world conditions. | Tool brittleness (auth failures, quotas/429s, timeouts, partial failures). Humans see "random flakiness" and manual firefighting. | Add retries with backoff + circuit breakers; classify failures into retryable/non-retryable; surface actionable error summaries in tickets; add health checks. Test: chaos tests injecting 401/403/429/timeouts and asserting correct fallback + ticket content. |
| Admin syncs an MCP server; agents start using the discovered tools. | Tool schema drift / brittle arg schemas (sync succeeds, but runtime calls fail due to required fields, type mismatches, or converter gaps). | Contract tests for each MCP tool; validate schemas on sync; constrain JSON-schema subset; log/deny tools with unsupported schemas until fixed. Test: schema conversion unit tests + contract tests that call tools against a local MCP fixture server. |
| Orchestrator spawns multiple sub-agents that touch shared artifacts (roadmap, release plan, stakeholder narrative). | Cross-agent coordination failures (local "correct" outputs that conflict globally; thrash and reversions). | Make dependencies explicit (DAG of artifacts and owners); mediate cross-agent communication through orchestrator; reduce coupling by design; add conflict detection + merge policies. Test: multi-agent scenario sim that forces concurrent edits and asserts conflict resolution rules. |
| Agents attempt restricted operations (spend money, send external comms, change prod config). | Security/policy surprises (unsafe actions attempted; approvals requested too late; audit trail incomplete). | Centralize gating: side effects only through governed wrappers; default-deny for new MCP tools; admin-only config endpoints; immutable audit/event log. Test: security tests proving "no side effect without approval" and correct role-based access. |
| Monday intake triggers a large fan-out of subtasks; system runs unattended overnight. | Cost and latency spikes (runaway spawn, queue growth, slow tool calls). Humans see late tickets and missed SLAs. | Add spawn budgets, concurrency limits, rate limiting, caching, and queue backpressure; instrument cost-per-run budgets and alerting. Test: load + soak tests validating throughput, stable queue depth, and cost ceilings under peak scenarios. |
