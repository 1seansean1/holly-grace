## §5  Phase ε — Execution (Conditional)

All §5 checks are **N/A** — slice 0 (pre-execution baseline), no code or test artifacts exist yet. This is correct and expected.

Three gating items flagged:
- §0.4.3 finding_register.csv: **FAIL** → creating as part of this run
- §0.4.4 trace_matrix.csv: **FAIL** → not yet needed at slice 0
- §0.4.5 gate_assessment.csv: N/A (§0.4 only lists 7 items; no §0.4.5 gate_assessment)

**§5 Result: 0 PASS, 0 FAIL, 22 N/A**

| §6.2.1 Node count matches N_nodes | **FAIL** | Agent counted 35, §0 says 34 → F-005 |
| §6.2.2 Edge count matches N_edges | **FAIL** | Agent counted 77, §0 says 80 → F-006 |

| §9.1.3 Every inventory entry in mermaid | PASS | |

*Disposition: CONDITIONAL PASS — 10 findings, none blocking slice 1 execution. All are document-control items (version string updates, count reconciliation, phase assignment clarification). Recommend fixing F-001 through F-003 (stale version references) immediately; F-004 through F-008 can be resolved during slice 1 setup.*
