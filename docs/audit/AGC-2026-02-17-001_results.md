## §5  Phase ε — Execution (Conditional)

All §5 checks are **N/A** — slice 0 (pre-execution baseline), no code or test artifacts exist yet. This is correct and expected.

Three gating items flagged:
- §0.4.3 finding_register.csv: **FAIL** → creating as part of this run
- §0.4.4 trace_matrix.csv: **FAIL** → not yet needed at slice 0
- §0.4.5 gate_assessment.csv: N/A (§0.4 only lists 7 items; no §0.4.5 gate_assessment)

**§5 Result: 0 PASS, 0 FAIL, 22 N/A**

| §6.1.4 DM phase consistency | **FAIL** | Mermaid puts DM in γ subgraph but inventory table says α → F-004 |
| §6.2.1 Node count matches N_nodes | **FAIL** | Agent counted 35, §0 says 34 → F-005 |
| §6.2.2 Edge count matches N_edges | **FAIL** | Agent counted 77, §0 says 80 → F-006 |
| §6.2.3 No duplicate edges | PASS | |

**§6 Result: 9 PASS, 4 FAIL → 9/13**

---

| §7.3.6 N_sad consistent | **FAIL** | §0=45, mermaid ~34 components, narrative "40+" → F-008 |
| §7.3.7 N_sil consistent | **FAIL** | §0=50, agents counted 47–49 → F-007 |
| §7.3.8 N_nodes consistent | **FAIL** | §0=34, §6 agent=35 → F-005 |

**§7 Result: 5 PASS, 4 FAIL, 1 PARTIAL → 5/10**

**§8 Result: 0 items, N/A**

## §9  Self-Consistency

| Check | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| §9.1.1 Inventory table complete | PASS | 16 in-repo + 1 external |
| §9.1.2 Every mermaid node in inventory | PASS | |
| §9.1.3 Every inventory entry in mermaid | PASS | |
| §9.2.1 Phase assignments consistent (most) | PASS | |
| §9.2.2 DM phase assignment | **FAIL** | Same as §6.1.4; mermaid γ vs inventory α → F-004 |
| §9.3.1 Derivation rules match edges | PASS | |
| §9.3.2 Timeline consistent with mermaid | PASS | |
